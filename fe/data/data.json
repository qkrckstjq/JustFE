For example, I get file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/4557D5E4-68BA-4341-9F4F-2A07D5E87B4D/tmp/runsomething.App-Inbox/myaudiofile.wav .I use Qt to develop an IOS application. I can open a sound file using the Qt file picker dialog and then I get the url to that sound file.

I then store this URL in a json file to later retrieve it. And the problem is that this seems to be a sort of temporary file url, because upon restart of my application, that URL does not work anymore.So, my question is how to handle this? Do I need to copy it myself to my own dir that I can create for example under the 'Library/Application Support' path: /var /mobile/Containers/Data/Application/4557D5E4-68BA-4341-9F4F-2A07D5E87B4D/Library/Application Support/App? Or is there some other way? I saw this post which allows a user to share a file with your application and seems to copy it inside your apps' storage. Then probably it will not be a 'tmp' file anymore and the link to that file will work even after application restarts. Is that how you should do it? I don't really like that approach and would like to avoid it if possible.",

Reading text and extracting text are generally the same thing. iText won't save the text to a file for you but once you have the text you should be able to do that fairly easily. iText does a really great job of extracting text as long as it is actually text (not outlines or bitmaps). When searching this site also look for iTextSharp which is the .Net port of iText. It has more questions/answers and the code is almost completely the same for C#.",

In Blazor Server this is even more relevant than other JS frameworks because the client needs to connect to the server for the logic to be executed. This is the pause or delay that you experience at the start, so given that you want to show the indicator specifically during this time where there is a delay for everything in the view port, then it makes sense that the default state should be for the indicator to be visible.",
